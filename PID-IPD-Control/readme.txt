# Metal Temperature Control System

The system is described in the attached report in "Temperature-Controller" folder. 

The .slx or Simulink file can be modified to shift the configuration change from PID to I-PD control simply by multiplying proportional and derivative gains by a negative sign. 

To initialize the value in above simulation use the MATLAB text file. 

Results for various configuration are attached along with.
