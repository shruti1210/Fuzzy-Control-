# Temperature-Controller

System Description - Attached along with the report. It is basically a metal-temperature control system

Earlier implemented in C#; I reimplemented the control system using MATLAB, and Simulink Real-time. 

Firstly system was identified, which was a non-linear system, with a fan to act as noise in the simulated environment

Later PID, I-PD and fuzzy logic based control algorithms were used and compared.
